# esp-moisture-notifier
A really basic platformio project to trigger an IFTTT notification if a plant's moisture sensor reads low values.
The IFTTT webhook trigger uses plain html call! Only use this solution, if your use-case allow this not really secure implementation.

Hardware is a D1-mini, with a capacitive soil moisture sensor, supplied by a 18650 power cell.
