 *	@brief ESPPowerManager implements practices to get the most lifespan out of
 *	battery cells, while keeping the full functionality of the esp8266 chips.
 *
 *	Lib was inspired by the esp posts on https://www.bakke.online
 *
 * 	@note Turned off wifi module also helps with more precise analog readings because
 * 	voltage do not gets fluctuated. RTC memory kept during deepsleep/resets, only gets
 * 	lost on power outage.
